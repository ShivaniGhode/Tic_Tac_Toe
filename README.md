# Tic_Tac_Toe

In this article, we will demonstrate how to build Tic Tac Toe Game using Java Swing library. This Tic Tac Toe Game allows you to Play a game easily using a graphical user interface (GUI) application. This game is develop with the Java Swing library which offers a set of components that can be use to build a Graphical user interface(GUI). This game has an easy and simple design with buttons to play the game. So grab a seat, pour a cup of coffee and start playing Tic Tac Toe Game.

This Tic Tac Toe Game is a Graphical user interface(GUI) Game that allows user to easily Play the game using buttons. Users may very quickly play the Game using the system simple design.

Button event is handled by the ActionListener interface and button events are defined using ActionListener’s actionPerformed() method. The winner of the game is checked using checkForWinner() method.

Methods used in the project: o) actionPerformed(): The action or events of the buttons are handled using this method. Buttons in the system to generate the value of button is handled using this method. This method describes how the component should behave after the button is click.
